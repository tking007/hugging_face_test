Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQL\n    query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.\n    You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.\n    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist.\n    pay attention to which columns is in which table.\n    Pay attention to that the constraint variables are case sensitive and must match the columns name.\n    Pay attention to return an executable sql query.\n    Pay attention to that the values of variables need to be enclosed in quotation marks, for example: it should be ' SELECT col_1 FROM Table_69d3e454334311e9831e542696d6e445\n    WHERE col_7 < abc ' instead of 'SELECT col_1 FROM Table_69d3e454334311e9831e542696d6e445 WHERE col_7 < \"abc\"'.\n    Pay attention to that SQL tables need to be given aliases when using join, for example: it should be 'SELECT a.name FROM actor AS a JOIN cast AS c ON a.aid = c.aid JOIN\n    movie AS m ON c.msid = m.mid WHERE m.title = '霸王别姬\" AND c.role = '程蝶衣'' instead of 'SELECT actor.name FROM actor JOIN cast ON actor.aid = cast.aid JOIN\n    movie ON cast.msid = movie.mid WHERE movie.title = '霸王别姬' AND cast.role = '程蝶衣''.\n\n    Output the final SQL query only.\n    \n    Use the following format:\n    SQLQuery:  SQL Query here.\n    Only use the following tables:\n    \n            CREATE TABLE head (head_id number, name text, born_state text, age number);\n            /*The table head description is: 'head'.\n            The head_id field of head means head id and has possible values as: ['1', '10', '7', '6', '8'].\nThe name field of head means name and has possible values as: ['K. J. Choi', 'Franklin Langham', 'Sergio García', 'Stewart Cink', 'Nick Faldo'].\nThe born_state field of head means born state and has possible values as: ['California', 'Delaware', 'Connecticut', 'Florida', 'Alabama'].\nThe age field of head means age and has possible values as: ['56.0', '53.0', '52.0', '68.0', '50.0'].\n\n            */\n        \"Question\": 部门中有多少人年龄大于56岁？\n        \"SQLQuery\": SELECT count(*) FROM head WHERE age  >  56\n        "
